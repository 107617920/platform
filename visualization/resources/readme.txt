The protovis implementation used here is not the one available via protovis general distribution.

Instead this is sources available from http://github.com/bigfix/protovis

The sources there are modified to take advantage of vml for IE. I cloned the ie branch with the commit id dd9e15455c86a833619f .
Note that simply downloading the sources yielded a package from a different branch, it is necessary to use git, then
run make to build the protovis debug and release files.
